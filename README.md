Solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

#Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

Data cleaning

Feature engineering

Modeling

Modelfine-tuning

#The main libraries involved are:

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for data visualization

Numpy for multidimensional array computing

sklearn for machine learning and predictive modeling
